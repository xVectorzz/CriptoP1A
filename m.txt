i still remember, third of december, me in your sweater
you said it looked better on me than it did you
only if you knew how much i liked you
but i watch your eyes as she
walks by
what a sight for sore eyes
brighter than the blue sky
she's got you mesmerized while i die
why would you ever kiss me?
i'm not even half as pretty
you gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
but you like her better
wish i were heather
watch as she stands with her, holding your hand
put your arm 'round her shoulder, now i'm getting colder
but how could i hate her? she's such an angel
but then again, kinda wish she were dead as she
walks by
what a sight for sore eyes
brighter than the blue sky
she's got you mesmerized while i die
why would you ever kiss me?
i'm not even half as pretty
you gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
but you like her better
i wish i were heather
i wish i were heather
(oh, oh)
wish i were heather
why would you ever kiss me?
i'm not even half as pretty
you gave her your sweater, it's just polyester
but you like her better
wish i were-
